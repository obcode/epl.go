// Package testdata holds the invented people every test in this repository shares.
//
// # Why a package and not a literal in each test
//
// Two reasons, and the second is the important one.
//
// The mundane reason is that visibility rules are always about a relationship: an owner, a
// colleague who must not see, someone whose role overrides both. Written inline, those roles
// get re-invented per test with different names, and a reader has to reconstruct which
// address was supposed to be the owner before they can judge whether the assertion is right.
//
// The reason that actually matters: this repository is public. The tempting way to write a
// fixture is to reach for a name that comes to mind, and the names that come to mind are the
// colleagues whose teaching assignments this system will manage — people who never agreed to
// appear in a public repository next to an overtime column. Providing a ready set of invented
// people removes the moment where someone has to invent one under time pressure.
//
// Everything here is fictional. The addresses are under example.org, which RFC 2606 reserves
// for exactly this, so no test can accidentally send mail to a real person.

// which is where the rules that use them live; duplicating them into fixtures would create a
// second list to keep in sync, and a stale role in a fixture makes a policy test pass while
// the policy is wrong. A test that needs a persona to hold a role says so at the call site —
// see Actor.

	// "seed everybody with their token" — the obvious setup helper for an API test — fail on
