// TestSeverityMakesTheRightThingsVisible pins the levels rather than the wording.
//
// It exists because of a concrete evening: the production container runs at Info, every
// refusal was logged at Debug, and a wave of 401s caused by an empty person table left no
// trace in the log at all. The person debugging it had to go through oauth2-proxy's log to
// find out who was being turned away by our own middleware.
//
// An internal test (package auth, not auth_test) so that severity can stay unexported: this
// is a decision about levels, not an API. It also avoids the alternative — capturing the
// global zerolog output — which would mean mutating a package-level variable while the rest
// of this suite runs in parallel, i.e. a data race the -race detector would rightly report.
